NPM(Node Package manager):
npm is the standard package manager for node.js
    it helps to use others code that was built
    it is library of packages
        eg for packages: Express.js, react.js
    it is also a command line tool
    npm is preinstalled with node
to install packages: npm install <package_name>  
we can search packages in website:https://www.npmjs.com/ 
 eg package : figlet which helps to print in command line: https://www.npmjs.com/package/figlet
by installing a package we get:
            node-modules: the node_module folder contains every installed dependency for your project
            package-lock.json : it records the exact version of every installed dependency, including 
                                it sun dependencies and their versions
            package.json: the package.json file contains descriptive and functional metadata about a project, such as a name, version, and dependencies
                            it helps to download dependencies if there are delete by the command: npm install
            we can also create our own package.json file for our project 
Global vs Local packages:
to download package Globally command: npm install -g <package_name>
and to use it command: npm link <package_name>
to make a package.json file our project :
    we use command: npm init;

import vs require:-

import{sum} from "./math.js";

we can't selectively load only the pieces we need with require but with import,
we can selectively load only the pieces we need, which can save memory.
Loading is synchronus for "require" but can be asynchronus for "import"
note: in a project we can use either import or require don't use both for a good code
to do import in a directory, the directory should contain package.json with type= "module" in it.

we can also import packages
    eg here we downloaded random-words package which is found in node_modules
    to use it should import it using "import"
  syntax:  import {generate} from random-words
